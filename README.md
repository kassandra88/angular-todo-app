# AngularTodoApp
The ToDo List Application is a simple web-based task management tool built with Angular. It allows users to create, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks, making it a handy tool for organizing your daily tasks.
## Development server

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
